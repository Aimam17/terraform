## Welcome
Thank You for your interest in Privateer and congratulations on making it to the technical interview 🫡. This exercise will evaluate you on common tasks that our Sr DevSecOps engineers are expected to be proficient. 


## Start Here
 These are the steps you should take to prepare your Local environment that we use during the evaluation. You are free to make any changes to the tool chain used in this repo as long as you're able to justify the changes. For example, you are free to use any kubernetes installation you wish. We recommend minikube, but you don't have to use that. If you do use other tools, expect to justify the decision. 

1. Clone or fork this repo 
1. Install [minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/) (or use any other local dev cluster engine)
1. Install [helm](https://helm.sh/)
1. Install [terraform](https://www.hashicorp.com/products/terraform)

## Prior to the evaluation

 you must have the following:
 
 * a working kubernetes cluster in your local environment 
 * the nginx helm chart deployed 
 
 
 If you have any questions or need help with this, that's OK, just reach out. It's better to ask questions than to show up unprepared.
